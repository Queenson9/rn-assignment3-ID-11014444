## Overview
The Task Tracker App is a detailed React Native application aimed at helping users efficiently manage and track their tasks across various categories, such as Exercise, Study, Code, Cook, and more. With an intuitive interface, the app simplifies the process of viewing, adding, organizing, and managing tasks, keeping users productive and organized.

## Components
* ### 1. View
* - Usage: The View component serves as the basic structure for app screens, acting as a container for other components. It helps in grouping and organizing related items.
* - Function: It manages layout by providing a flexible box model to position child components. For example, a View can be used to encapsulate the home screen layout or to group a task's title and description.
* 
* ### 2. Text
* - Usage: The Text component is used to display text on the screen, including titles, task descriptions, and labels.
* - Function: This component allows for various styling options to format text, such as font size, color, alignment, and weight. It can render the main screen title "Task Categories" or detailed task descriptions.
* 
* ### 3. ScrollView
* - Usage: The ScrollView component enables vertical scrolling for content that extends beyond the screen’s viewable area, providing a smooth scrolling experience.
* - Function: It is ideal for screens with long lists of items or complex forms. In the Task Tracker App, ScrollView might be used to wrap the list of tasks, allowing users to scroll through their ongoing tasks without losing context.
* 
* ### 4. TextInput
* - Usage: The TextInput component is crucial for capturing user input, used for adding new tasks or editing existing ones.
* - Function: It supports various configurations like placeholder text, keyboard type, and secure text entry for passwords. For instance, a TextInput allows users to type in the description of a new task they wish to add.
* 
* ### 5. Stylesheet
* - Usage: The Stylesheet is a tool for defining and managing styles within a React Native application, ensuring a consistent design.
* - Function: By centralizing styles in a Stylesheet, the app maintains a cohesive and visually appealing interface. Styles can include properties like margin, padding, font styles, and colors, which are crucial for a unified design.
* 
* ### 6. Button
* - Usage: The Button component is used to perform actions like adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, or navigating between screens.
* - Function: Buttons can be customized in terms of text, color, and action handlers. For example, an "Add Task" button can submit a new task, while a "Complete" button might change a task’s status.
* 
* ### 7. FlatList
* - Usage: The FlatList component efficiently renders large lists of data, making it ideal for displaying tasks.
* - Function: It supports features like item separators, headers, footers, and pull-to-refresh. In the Task Tracker App, FlatList might be used to display all ongoing tasks within each category, ensuring smooth scrolling even with many tasks.
* 
* ### 8. Image
* - Usage: The Image component displays images and icons, enhancing the app’s visual appeal.
* - Function: It can load images from local resources or remote URLs. For example, icons representing different task categories (e.g., an exercise icon for Exercise tasks) help users quickly identify task types.
* 
* ## Task Categories
* The application organizes tasks into the following categories, each represented by unique icons:
* 1. Exercise: Tasks related to physical activities like running or gym sessions.
* 2. Study: Academic tasks such as homework or reading chapters.
* 3. Code: Programming tasks, including coding projects and bug fixes.
* 4. Cook: Culinary tasks like preparing meals or baking.
* 5. Work: Professional tasks such as meetings or writing reports.
* 6. Shopping: Tasks involving purchasing items.
* 7. Cleaning: Household chores like vacuuming or doing laundry.
* 8. Reading: Tasks related to reading books or articles.
* 
* ## Ongoing Tasks
* Here are 15 ongoing tasks across the categories:
* 1. Exercise - Morning run
* 2. Exercise- Gym session
* 3. Study- Math homework
* 4. Study- Read history chapter
* 5. Code- Fix bug in project
* 6. Code- Implement new feature
* 7. Cook- Prepare lunch
* 8. Cook- Bake cookies
* 9. Work- Finish report
* 10. Work- Team meeting
* 11. Shopping- Buy groceries
* 12. Shopping- Get new shoes
* 13. Cleaning- Vacuum living room
* 14. Cleaning- Laundry
* 15. Reading- Finish novel
* 
* ## Custom Components
* To enhance code reusability and maintainability, the app includes several custom components:
* - TaskItem: Renders individual tasks, displaying the task description, status, and actions like marking the task as complete.
* - CategoryHeader: Displays category titles with icons, helping users quickly identify different sections.
* - AddTaskForm: Encapsulates the form elements needed to add a new task, including input fields and submission buttons.
* 
* ## Styles
* The app employs a centralized styling approach to ensure consistency across all components. Styles are managed through a Stylesheet, which defines properties such as layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. This centralized management helps maintain a uniform look and feel throughout the app and simplifies style updates across multiple components.
* 
* ## Conclusion
* The Task Tracker App is a versatile and powerful tool for managing tasks across various categories. Its user-friendly design, efficient task management features, and custom components help users stay organized and productive. By leveraging essential React Native components, the app delivers a seamless and engaging user experience, making task management both easy and effective.
